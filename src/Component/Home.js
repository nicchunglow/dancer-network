          This web-app aims to bring the dance community together by connecting
          daners to various dance events! As this app progress, it hopes to
          connect with dancers locally, in Singapore, first before reaching
          other events in the regional countries, and hopefully the rest of the
          world, in the future. If you like the idea, do use it and share it
          with your friends!
